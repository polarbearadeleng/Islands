##### Islands

##### Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two integers, r and c (r >= 1, c <= 50), which are the number of rows and the number of columns of the image. The next r lines will each contain exactly c characters, consisting only of ‘L’ (representing Land), ‘W’ (representing Water), and ‘C’ (representing Clouds).

##### Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of islands possible.
